        <span><i>With Agents for Change, Capital Region homebuyers and sellers donate to causes they care about most.</i></span>
        <br /><br />
        <p><b>Albany, NY (March 13, 2017)</b> - Realtor Dave Chidyllo is no stranger to giving back. Chidyllo has Hemophilia A, and as a child he attended summer camp at the Double H Ranch, an Adirondack camp for kids with critical illnesses. It was a powerful experience that inspired Chidyllo to do meaningful work. So as a young adult, he worked at Double H Ranch for ten summers—and it was then that philanthropy become one of his core values.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, seasoned realtor Jim Rosenberger wanted to make his work more meaningful. Rosenberger has sold over 100 houses in the Capital Region. Buying and selling real estate, he's learned, is a major milestone in a person's life.  Both agents wondered—could they make the purchase or sale of real estate more socially impactful?</p>
        <p>So together, the two Falvey Real Estate Group colleagues formed Agents for Change. Every time a client buys or sells a house, Chidyllo and Rosenberger will donate 10% of their personal commission to a charity of the client's choice.</p>
        <p>"Maybe you're passionate about animal welfare, or maybe you care deeply about hunger relief. We're giving people the opportunity to put their money where their values are," Chidyllo says.</p>
        <p>Rosenberger agrees. "I already get to change somebody's life by helping them find a home. We're adding another level of meaning and substance to that."</p>
        <p>Here's how it works: A buyer or seller chooses either Chidyllo or Rosenberger to be their real estate agent. Upon the purchase or sale of their home, the buyer/seller chooses a charity they'd like to make a donation to (it has to be a registered 501(c)(3)). Chidyllo and Rosenberger then give ten percent of their personal commission to the charity of choice.</p>
        <p>"At the end of the day,” Chidyllo says, "there are two places for that money to go: into the realtor's pocket or back to a charity. Isn't that nicer that it goes to produce some good in the world?"</p>
        <p>The program, Rosenberger notes, helps people make sizeable donations to causes they believe in. "We're empowering them to make a large gift that they might not otherwise be able to make," he says.</p>
